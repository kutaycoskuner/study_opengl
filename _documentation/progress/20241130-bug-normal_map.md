- <normal map debugging>
    - lighting is not as expected 
    - isolated only the point lights
    - changing values on renderdocs to understand what is wrong.
    - first aattempt to see view_direction
        - I set camera to 0, 8, 10
        - I look at plane and visualize view direction
        - expected to see green blue transition
            - texture is black to red from left to right
            - normalized and used absolute value to -> saw something what I have been expecting
            - normal vis -> normaller problmeli geciyor. uste bakan yuz yesil olamsi gerekirken maviyid

- <normal map complex models>
    - I need complex 3d models to check if my tangent calculation on model import works
    - found gltf sample models
    - used sponza
        - encountered with a problem
        - noticed that I disabled importer downloads on cmake
        - activated gltf import
        - imported sponza
            - problem: scale is too big I have only one point light not enough to illuminate whole scene
            - quickfix: scale model problem todo: better parametric solution
            - problem: only normal is the one coming from primitive scene node -> brick
            - fix: changed enum values of height to normal on assimp
            - problem: on sponza arch normals does not seem to be right
                - normal maaps are not loading
                - fix: asset importta texture binding numralari farkli
